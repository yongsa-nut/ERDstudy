Title of Project: Human AI Collaboration

Sponsor: National Science Foundation

 

Request to Participate in Research

We would like to invite you to take part in a web-based research project. The purpose of this research is to study how people make decisions and work with Artificial Intelligence (AI)/robots or human collaborators in various search and delivery situations.

 

You must be at least 18 years old to be in this research project.

The study will take place at your own computer and will take about 25 minutes. If you decide to take part in this study, we will ask you to fill out a survey and play a game about making decisions and working with either a robot or a human.

There are no foreseeable risks or discomforts to you for taking part in this study.

There are no direct benefits to you for participating in the study. However, your answers may help us to learn more about how people make decisions and work with robots or human collaborators in various search and deliver situations.

Your part in this study will be handled in a confidential manner. Only the researchers will know that you participated in this study. Any reports or publications based on this research will use only group data and will not identify you or any individual as being of this project.

It is possible that respondents could be identified by the IP address or other electronic record associated with the response. Neither the researcher nor anyone involved with this survey will be capturing those data. The only individually-identifying data we receive from your crowdsourcing platform or panel is your unique identifier and your country. Your data are also stored on your platform or panel’s servers, and the data there are subject to their respective Privacy Notice and Participation Agreements.

If you have any questions regarding electronic privacy, please feel free to contact Northeastern University’s Office of Information Security via phone at 617-373-7901, or via email at privacy@neu.edu.

The decision to participate in this research project is up to you. You do not have to participate and you can refuse to answer any question. Even if you begin the study, you may withdraw at any time. If you do not complete the task payment will not be made.

You will be paid according to your crowdsourcing platform or panel’s reward guidelines for completing the task.

If you have any questions about this study, please feel free to contact Nutchanon Yongsatianchot (nutjung.nutlc@gmail.com), the person mainly responsible for the research. You can also contact Stacy Marsella (s.marsella@northeastern.edu), the Principal Investigator.

If you have any questions about your rights in this research, you may contact Nan C. Regina, Director, Human Subject Research Protection, Mail Stop: 560-177, 360 Huntington Avenue, Northeastern University, Boston, MA  02115. Tel:  617.373.4588, Email: n.regina@northeastern.edu. You may call anonymously if you wish.

This study has been reviewed and approved by the Northeastern University Institutional Review Board (#22-02-14).
